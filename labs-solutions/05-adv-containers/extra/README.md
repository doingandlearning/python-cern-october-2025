## Learning Objectives

Each task reinforces specific concepts:

1. **Task 1**: Basic dictionary operations (access, add, update, remove)
2. **Task 2**: Dictionary methods (.keys(), .values(), .items())
3. **Task 3**: Dictionary-based counting and frequency analysis
4. **Task 4**: Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
5. **Task 5**: List comprehensions for data transformation
6. **Task 6**: Nested dictionaries and complex data structures
7. **Task 7**: Combining sets and dictionaries for data analysis
8. **Task 8**: Advanced list comprehensions with conditions

## Key Concepts Practiced

- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, accessing values, updating data
- **Sets**: Unique collections, set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- **List Comprehensions**: Efficient list creation with conditions
- **Data Processing**: Real-world scientific and engineering scenarios
- **Control Flow**: Loops and conditionals with data structures

## Scientific Context

All examples use realistic scientific and engineering scenarios:
- Sensor readings and measurements
- Laboratory inventory management
- Research team collaboration
- Experimental data analysis
- Equipment tracking and maintenance
