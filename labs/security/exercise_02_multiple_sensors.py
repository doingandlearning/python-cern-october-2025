Exercise 2: Multiple Sensors with Timing
=======================================

This exercise demonstrates running multiple threads simultaneously with
different timing patterns, similar to the original Lab 16 but with
a security system context.

Learning Objectives:
- Create multiple threads
- Use different timing patterns for each thread
- Observe concurrent execution and output interleaving
- Understand thread independence

Task: Create multiple security sensors that run concurrently with different
monitoring intervals.
