# **Lab 04 Extra: Practice with Lists and Tuples**

## **Objective**
This extra lab provides additional practice with lists and tuples using simple, practical examples. You will reinforce your understanding of basic container operations without using functions.

You will:
1. **Work with simple data** using lists and tuples
2. **Practice basic operations** like indexing, slicing, and iteration
3. **Use loops and conditionals** with containers
4. **Solve practical problems** step by step

## **Tasks**

### **1. Student Grade Tracker**

You have a list of student grades stored as tuples: `(student_name, grade)`

```python
# Sample data
grades = [
    ("Alice", 85), ("Bob", 92), ("Charlie", 78), 
    ("Diana", 96), ("Eve", 88), ("Frank", 73)
]
```

**Tasks:**
- Print all student names
- Print all grades
- Find the highest grade
- Find the lowest grade
- Calculate the average grade
- Print students with grades above 85

---

### **2. Shopping List Manager**

Create a shopping list and work with it:

```python
# Start with this shopping list
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "milk", "bread", "eggs"]
```

**Tasks:**
- Print the shopping list
- Add "cheese" to the end
- Add "butter" at position 2
- Remove "milk" from the list
- Print the first 3 items
- Print the last 2 items
- Check if "bread" is in the list
- Print the length of the list

---

### **3. Number Analysis**

Work with a list of numbers:

```python
# Sample numbers
numbers = [15, 23, 8, 42, 17, 31, 6, 55, 29, 12]
```

**Tasks:**
- Print all numbers
- Count how many numbers are even
- Count how many numbers are odd
- Find the largest number
- Find the smallest number
- Print numbers greater than 20
- Print numbers between 10 and 30
- Calculate the sum of all numbers

---

### **4. Coordinate Pairs**

Work with coordinate data:

```python
# Sample coordinates (x, y)
coordinates = [(0, 0), (3, 4), (1, 1), (5, 12), (2, 2)]
```

**Tasks:**
- Print all coordinates
- Print just the x-coordinates
- Print just the y-coordinates
- Find the coordinate with the largest x-value
- Find the coordinate with the largest y-value
- Print coordinates where both x and y are greater than 2

---

### **5. Temperature Readings**

Process daily temperature data:

```python
# Daily temperatures (day, temperature)
temperatures = [
    ("Monday", 22), ("Tuesday", 25), ("Wednesday", 23),
    ("Thursday", 27), ("Friday", 24), ("Saturday", 26), ("Sunday", 21)
]
```

**Tasks:**
- Print all temperatures
- Find the hottest day
- Find the coldest day
- Print days with temperature above 24
- Print days with temperature below 25
- Calculate the average temperature

---

### **6. Word List Operations**

Work with a list of words:

```python
# Sample words
words = ["python", "programming", "computer", "science", "data", "analysis"]
```

**Tasks:**
- Print all words
- Print words longer than 6 characters
- Print words that start with 'p'
- Print words that end with 'n'
- Count how many words have exactly 5 letters
- Print the longest word
- Print the shortest word

---

### **7. Mixed Data Processing**

Work with mixed data types:

```python
# Mixed data: (name, age, is_student)
people = [
    ("Alice", 25, True), ("Bob", 30, False), ("Charlie", 22, True),
    ("Diana", 35, False), ("Eve", 19, True), ("Frank", 28, True)
]
```

**Tasks:**
- Print all names
- Print all ages
- Print names of students
- Print names of non-students
- Print people older than 25
- Print people younger than 30
- Count how many students there are
- Count how many non-students there are

---

### **8. Simple Statistics**

Calculate basic statistics from a list:

```python
# Sample data
scores = [78, 85, 92, 67, 89, 94, 76, 88, 91, 83]
```

**Tasks:**
- Print all scores
- Find the highest score
- Find the lowest score
- Calculate the average score
- Count scores above 85
- Count scores below 80
- Print scores in the 80s (80-89)
- Print scores in the 90s (90-99)

---

## **Tips for Success**

- **Use loops** to go through lists and tuples
- **Use if statements** to check conditions
- **Use indexing** to access specific elements
- **Use slicing** to get parts of lists
- **Use len()** to get the length of containers
- **Use in** to check if something is in a list
- **Use append()** to add items to lists
- **Use remove()** to remove items from lists

**Good luck and have fun practicing with lists and tuples!**
